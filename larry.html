      <p>As you probably already know by now, my name is Larry Pilgrim.  I currently live in Stanley with
	    my girlfriend Niki and my four kids: Breleigh(5), Crindon(3), Temperance(1), and Drake(1).  In 
      addition, my girlfriend has two kids with 50% custody from a previous marriage.  They are Connor(12) 
      and Keondric(10).  Oh yeah, I had better include our cat, Belle, who is about a year-and-a-half old.
	  </p>
	  <p>That's probably good enough for this assignment.  I'm assuming Brian just wants us to get used to 
	    using Git and GitHub and whatnot, and is probably less concerned about the appearance and information 
	    in this current project.  That's also why I didn't spend too much time styling my page.
	  </p>
	  <p>I'm about done now so if you did in fact make it this far, well, congratulations.  I've officially
	    managed to waste a minute or two of your time!  Ok then.  See ya'll in class!
